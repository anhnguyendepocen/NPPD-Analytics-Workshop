# MLB rules for the greatest all-time hitters are that players have to have
# played at least 1000 games with at least 1000 at-bats in order to be considered

# Extend the for loop above to collect the additional information
# Introduce and collect data for two new variables: games and atbats

# Find some summary statistics for each of the teams (variable team):
# How many different (unique) players has the team had?
# What was the teamâ€™s first/last season?
# Challenge: Find the number of players on each team over time. Does the number change?
