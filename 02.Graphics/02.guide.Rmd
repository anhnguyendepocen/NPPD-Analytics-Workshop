# Basic Plots

## Setup

Run the [Setup.R](./code/Setup.R) file.

If everything works correctly, you should see a plot:
```{r, echo = F, fig.height = 4}
qplot(rnorm(100), rnorm(100), color = rbinom(100, 5, 0.2))
```

## ggplot2 In a Nutshell

- Package for statistical graphics
- Developed by Hadley Wickham
- Designed to adhere to good graphical practices
- Supports a wide variety plot types
- Constructs plots using the concept of layers\medskip
- http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/ or Hadley's book *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis}* for reference material


## *qplot*

The *qplot()* function is the basic workhorse of ggplot2

- Produces all plot types available with ggplot2
- Allows for plotting options within the function statement
- Creates an object that can be saved
- Plot layers can be added to modify plot complexity

The *qplot()* function has a basic syntax:

*qplot(variables, plot type, dataset, options)*

- variables: list of variables used for the plot
- plot type: specified with a *geom =* statement
- dataset: specified with a *data =* statement
- options: there are so, so many options!

## Diamonds Data

Objective: Explore the diamonds data set (preloaded along with ggplot2) using `qplot` for basic plotting.

The data set was scraped from a diamond exchange company data base.  It contains the prices and attributes of over 50,000 diamonds.

### Examining the Diamonds Data

What does the data look like?

Look at the top few rows of the diamond data frame to find out!

```{r}
head(diamonds)
```

## Basic Scatterplots

Basic scatter plot of diamond price vs. carat weight

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
qplot(carat, price, geom = "point", data = diamonds)
```

Scatter plot of diamond price vs carat weight showing versitility of options in `qplot`

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
qplot(carat, log(price), geom = "point", data = diamonds, 
      alpha = I(0.2), color = color, 
      main = "Log price by carat weight, grouped by color") + 
  xlab("Carat Weight") + ylab("Log Price")
```

## Your Turn

All of the "Your Turns" for this section will use the tips data set:

```{r}
tips <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/2gGoiLR")
```

1. Use qplot to build a scatterplot of variables tips and total bill
2. Use options within qplot to color points by smokers
3. Clean up axis labels and add main plot title

### Solutions
1. Scatterplot of variables tips and total bill
```{r}
qplot(data = tips, x = total_bill, y = tip)
```

2. Color points by smokers
```{r, tidy = F}
qplot(data = tips, x = total_bill, y = tip, color = smoker)
```

3. Pretty axis lables and title
```{r, tidy = F, fig.height = 3}
qplot(data = tips, x = total_bill, y = tip, color = smoker,
      xlab = "Total Bill ($)", ylab = "Tip ($)", 
      main = "Tip left by patrons' total bill and smoking status")
```


# Plotting Map Data

To make a map, load up the states data and take a look:

```{r}
states <- map_data("state")
head(states)
```

## Basic Map Data

What data is needed in order to plot a basic map?

- Latitude/longitude points for all map boundaries
- Which boundary group all lat/long points belong
- The order to connect points within each group

The *states* data has all necessary information

## A Basic Map

A bunch of latitude longitude points...

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
qplot(long, lat, geom = "point", data = states)
```

... that are connected with lines in a very specific order.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
qplot(long, lat, geom = "path", data = states, group = group) + 
  coord_map()
```

## Polygon vs Path
Polygons are shapes that can be filled. Paths are lines that have no fill color. 
Polygons are often more appropriate for showing additional information on a map.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
qplot(long, lat, geom = "polygon", 
      data = states, group = group) + 
  coord_map()

# Fancier map
qplot(long, lat, geom = "polygon", 
      fill = I("white"), color = I("black"),
      data = states, group = group) + 
  coord_map()
```

## Incorporating Information

- Add other geographic information by adding geometric layers to the plot
- Add non-geopgraphic information by altering the fill color for each state
- Use `geom = "polygon"` to treat states as solid shapes
- Show numeric information with color shade/intensity
- Show categorical information using color hue

### Categorical Data

If a categorical variable is assigned as the fill color then `qplot` will assign different hues for each category. 

Load in a state regions dataset:

```{r, echo = 2:3}
statereg <- read.csv("https://srvanderplas.github.io/NPPD-Analytics-Workshop/02.Graphics/data/statereg.csv")
statereg <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/2i0AFHK")
head(statereg)
```

### Joining Data

`join` or `merge` the original states data with new info 

The `left_join` function is used for merging\*\*:

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(dplyr)
states.class.map <- left_join(states, statereg, by = c("region" = "State"))
head(states.class.map)
```

\*\* More on this later



### Plotting the Result

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
qplot(long, lat, geom = "polygon", data = states.class.map, 
      group = group, fill = StateGroups, color = I("black")) + 
  coord_map() 
```

## Numerical Data & Maps

- Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
- 2008 telephone survey run by the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
- Ask a variety of questions related to health and wellness
- Cleaned data with state aggregated values posted on website

### BRFSS Data Aggregated by State

```{r, echo = 2:3}
states.stats <- read.csv("https://srvanderplas.github.io/NPPD-Analytics-Workshop/02.Graphics/data/states.stats.csv")
states.stats <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/2gT95Hc")

head(states.stats)
```

#### Join the data again

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
states.map <- left_join(states, states.stats, by = c("region" = "state.name"))
head(states.map)
```

#### Shade and Intensity

Average # of days in the last 30 days of insufficient sleep

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
qplot(long, lat, geom = "polygon", data = states.map, 
      group = group, fill = avg.qlrest2) + coord_map()
```

### BRFSS Data by Gender and State

```{r}
states.sex.stats <- read.csv("https://srvanderplas.github.io/NPPD-Analytics-Workshop/02.Graphics/data/states.sex.stats.csv")
states.sex.stats <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/2hiKFIb")
head(states.sex.stats)
```

Join the data again

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
states.sex.map <- left_join(states, states.sex.stats, by = c("region" = "state.name"))
head(states.sex.map)
```

#### Adding Information

Average # of alcoholic drinks per day by state and gender

```{r, fig.height=3}
qplot(long, lat, geom = "polygon", data = states.sex.map, 
      group = group, fill = avg.drnk) + coord_map() + 
  facet_grid(sex ~ .)
```

## Your Turn

- Use `left_join` to combine child healthcare data with maps information.     
You can load in the child healthcare data with:

```{r}
states.health.stats <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/2hRBMq0")
```

- Use `qplot` to create a map of child healthcare undercoverage rate by state

### Solutions
```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(maps)
library(dplyr)
states <- map_data("state")
states.health.map <- left_join(states, states.health.stats, 
                               by = c("region" = "state.name"))

# Use qplot to create a map of child healthcare undercoverage rate by state

qplot(data = states.health.map, x = long, y = lat, geom = 'polygon',
      group = group, fill = no.coverage) + coord_map()
```

## Cleaning Up Maps

Use ggplot2 options to clean up the map!

- Add Titles `+ ggtitle(...)`
- Use a plain white background `+ theme_bw()`
- Familiar geography may eliminate need for latitude and longitude axes `+ theme(...)`
- Customize color gradient `+ scale_fill_gradient2(...)`
- Keep aspect ratios correct `+ coord_map()`

```{r}
qplot(long, lat, geom = "polygon", data = states.map, 
      group = group, fill = avg.drnk) + 
  coord_map() +  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(
    name = "Avg Drinks",
    limits = c(1.5, 3.5), 
    low = "lightgray", high = "red") + 
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank()) +
  ggtitle("Average Number of Alcoholic Beverages 
          Consumed Per Day by State")
```

## Your Turn

Use options to polish the look of the map of child healthcare undercoverage rate by state!

### Solutions 
```{r}
qplot(data = states.health.map, x = long, y = lat, 
      geom = 'polygon', group = group, fill = no.coverage) + 
  coord_map() + 
  scale_fill_gradient2(
    name = "Child\nHealthcare\nUndercoverage",
    limits = c(0, .2), 
    low = 'white', high = 'red') + 
  ggtitle("Health Insurance in the U.S.\n
          Which states have the highest rates 
          of undercovered children?") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), 
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank())	
```

# Plotting Using Layers

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

states <- map_data("state")
```

## Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill
![](images/satelitepicBPoilspill.png)

### Datasets
NOAA Data:
- National Oceanic and Administration 
- Temperature and Salinity Data in the Gulf of Mexico
- Measured using Floats, Gliders and Boats


US Fisheries and Wildlife Data:

- Animal Sightings on the Gulf Coast
- Birds, Turtles and Mammals
- Status: Oil Covered or Not

Both data sets have geographic coordinates for every observation


### Loading NOAA Data

NOAA data is a .rdata file. Read it in:

1. Download the data from http://heike.github.io/rwrks/02-r-graphics/data/noaa.rdata
2. Run the `getwd()` command to find your current working directory
3. Place noaa.rdata in the directory from step 2.
4. Run the command below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
load("noaa.rdata")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = F}
library(ggplot2)
states <- map_data("state")
load("./data/noaa.rdata")
```


### Floats

Take a peek at the top of the floats NOAA data:

```{r}
head(floats, n = 2)[,1:5]
head(floats, n = 2)[,6:10]
head(floats, n = 2)[,11:14]
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
qplot(Longitude, Latitude, color = callSign, data = floats) + 
  coord_map()
```

### Gliders

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
qplot(Longitude, Latitude, color = callSign, data = gliders) + 
  coord_map()
```

### Boats

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
qplot(Longitude, Latitude, color = callSign, data = boats) + 
  coord_map()
```

## Layering

The NOAA data has the same context - a common time and common place

- Want to aggregate information from different sources onto a common plot
- Start with a common background the lat/long grid
- Superimpose data onto the grid in layers using `ggplot2`

#### Preview

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = states, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  geom_point(data = floats, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, color = callSign)) +   
  geom_point(aes(x, y), shape = "x", size = 5, data = rig) + 
  geom_text(aes(x, y), label = "BP Oil Rig", 
            size = 5, data = rig, hjust = -0.1) + 
  xlim(c(-91, -80)) + ylim(c(22,32)) + coord_map()
```


## What is a Plot?

- Most maps (and many plots) have multiple layers of data. 
- The layers may be from the same or different datasets.
- ggplot2 makes it easy to add layers to a plot.

Plots have:
- A default dataset 
- A coordinate system
- layers of geometric objects (geoms)
- A set of aesthetic mappings (taking information from the data and converting into an attribute of the plot)
- A scale for each aesthetic
- A facetting specification (multiple plots based on subsetting the data)


### Example: Floats Decomposed

**Data**: floats, states

<table>
<tr>
<td>
**Mappings**: 
<table>
<tr>
<td>aesthetic</td><td> mapping</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x</td><td>Longitude</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>y</td><td>Latitude</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>color</td><td>CallSign</td>
</tr>
</table>
</td>
<td>
**Scales**:
<table>
<tr>
<td>aesthetic</td><td> scale</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x</td><td>continuous</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>y</td><td>continuous</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>color</td><td>discrete</td>
</tr>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
**Geoms**: Points (floats), lines (states)

**Facetting**: None

## `qplot` vs `ggplot`

`qplot()` stands for "quickplot":

- Automatically chooses default settings to make life easier
- Less control over plot construction

`ggplot()` stands for "grammar of graphics plot"

- Contructs the plot using components listed in previous slides


There are two ways to construct the same plot for float locations:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
qplot(Longitude, Latitude, color = callSign, data = floats) 
```

Or:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = floats, 
       aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, color = callSign)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous() + 
  scale_y_continuous() + 
  scale_color_discrete()
```

It is not necessary to specify everything when using `ggplot`. The function will automatically pick default scales if none are specified. 
```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
ggplot(data = floats, 
       aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, color = callSign)) +
  geom_point()
```


## Your Turn

Find the `ggplot()` statement that creates this plot:

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = Depth, y = Temperature, color = callSign), data = floats) + geom_point()
```

Hint: look at the Floats data for variable ideas

### Solutions
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = Depth, y = Temperature, color = callSign), 
       data = floats) + 
  geom_point()
```


## What is a Layer?

A layer added `ggplot()` can be a geom...

- The type of geometric object
- The statistic mapped to that object
- The data set from which to obtain the statistic

... or a position adjustment to the scales

- Changing the axes scale
- Changing the color gradient


### Examples

Plot               Geom             Stat
------------------ ---------------- -----------------
Scatterplot        point            identity
Histogram          bar              bin count
Smoother           line + ribbon    smoother function
Binned Scatterplot rectange + color 2d bin count

More geoms described at http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/

## Piecing Things Together

Build a map using NOAA data

- Coordinate system (mapping Long-Lat to X-Y)
- Add layer of state outlines
- Add layer of points for float locations
- Add layers for Oil Rig marker and label
- Adjust the range of x and y scales

#### The Result

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, warning=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = states, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  geom_point(data = floats, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, color = callSign)) +   
  geom_point(aes(x, y), shape = "x", size = 5, data = rig) + 
  geom_text(aes(x, y), label = "BP Oil Rig", size = 5, data = rig, hjust = -0.1) + 
  xlim(c(-91, -80)) + 
  ylim(c(22, 32)) + coord_map()
```


## Your Turn
```{r}
animal <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/2hNlTUl")
```
1. Read in the animal.csv data:    
(Data of animal sightings around the Deepwater Site)
2. Plot the location of animal sightings on a map of the region
3. On this plot, try to color points by class of animal and/or status of animal
4. **Advanced**: Is there a way to indicate time?

```{r}
library(lubridate)
animal$month <- month(as.Date(animal$Date_))
```

### Solutions

2. Plot the location of animal sightings on a map

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_path(data = states, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  geom_point(data = animal, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude)) + 
  xlim(c(-91, -80)) + ylim(c(24,32)) + coord_map()
```

3. On this plot, try to color points by class of animal and/or status of animal
```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_path(data = states, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  geom_point(data = animal, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, 	
                                color = class)) + 
  xlim(c(-91, -80)) + ylim(c(24,32)) + coord_map()
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_path(data = states, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  geom_point(data = animal, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, 	
                                color = Condition)) + 
  xlim(c(-91, -80)) + ylim(c(24,32)) + coord_map()
```

4. **Advanced**: Is there a way to indicate time?
```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_path(data = states, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  geom_point(data = animal, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, 	
                                color = Condition), alpha = .5) +
  xlim(c(-91, -80)) + ylim(c(24,32)) +
  facet_wrap(~month) + coord_map() 	
```

# Perception

The motivation for this section is to establish why some plots are easier to read than others. 

The plot below shows a portion of a figure which was supposed to demonstrate how much it cost to get various degrees in different provinces of Canada. 

![](images/junkcharts.png)

It is difficult to compare the different provinces on average or across programs, and it is extremely difficult to draw sweeping conclusions about the expense of obtaining an education. The plot is confusing and not particularly useful. 

## Good Graphics

Graphics consist of:

- Structure (boxplot, scatterplot, etc.)
- Aesthetics: features such as 
    - color
    - shape
    - size     
that map other characteristics to structural features

Both the structure and aesthetics should help viewers interpret the information.

In order to understand how to create good graphics, it is necessary to briefly discuss the human perceptual system. 

### Pre-Attentive Features

- Things that "jump out" in less than 250 ms
- Color, form, movement, spatial localization

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)

data <- data.frame(expand.grid(x = 1:6, y = 1:6), color = sample(c(1, 2), 36, replace = TRUE))
data$x <- data$x + rnorm(36, 0, .25)
data$y <- data$y + rnorm(36, 0, .25)
data$shape <- c(rep(2, 15), 1, rep(2,20))

new_theme_empty <- theme_bw()
new_theme_empty$line <- element_blank()
new_theme_empty$rect <- element_blank()
new_theme_empty$strip.text <- element_blank()
new_theme_empty$axis.text <- element_blank()
new_theme_empty$plot.title <- element_blank()
new_theme_empty$axis.title <- element_blank()
new_theme_empty$plot.margin <- structure(c(0, 0, -1, -1), unit = "lines", valid.unit = 3L, class = "unit")

qplot(x, y, data = data, color = factor(1, levels = 1:2), shape = factor(shape), size = I(5)) +
  scale_shape_manual(guide = "none", values = c(19, 15)) + 
  scale_color_discrete(guide = "none") + 
  new_theme_empty
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, echo=FALSE}
data$shape <- c(rep(2, 25), 1, rep(2, 10))
qplot(x, y, data = data, color = factor(shape), shape = I(19), size = I(5)) +
  scale_shape_manual(guide = "none", values = c(19, 15)) + 
  scale_color_discrete(guide = "none") + 
  new_theme_empty
```

Color is stronger (faster) than shape. 

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, echo=FALSE}
data$shape2 <- data$color
qplot(x, y, data = data, color = factor(color), shape = factor(shape2), size = I(5)) +
  scale_shape_manual(guide = "none", values = c(19, 15)) + 
  scale_color_discrete(guide = "none") + 
  new_theme_empty
```

Combinations of pre-attentive features are usually not pre-attentive due to **interference**

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, echo=FALSE}
data$shape2[16] <- if (data$shape2[16] == 2) 1 else 2

qplot(x, y, data = data, color = factor(color), shape = factor(shape2), size = I(5)) +
  scale_shape_manual(guide = "none", values = c(19, 15)) + 
  scale_color_discrete(guide = "none") + 
  new_theme_empty
```

## Your Turn

Find ways to improve the following graphic:

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=7, out.width = "60%"}
frame <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/2i3Q4Gf")
qplot(x, y, data = frame, shape = g1, colour = g2, size = I(4))
```

- Make sure the "oddball" stands out while keeping the information on the groups
- Hint: `interaction` combines factor variables

### Solutions

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, out.width = "60%"}
# Make sure the "oddball" stands out while keeping the 
# information on the groups
frame$inter <- interaction(frame$g1, frame$g2)
ggplot(frame, aes(x, y)) +  
  geom_point(aes(shape = g1, color = inter), size = I(4))
```

Another (more elegant, but more complicated) solution: 

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, out.width = "60%"}
# Make sure the "oddball" stands out while keeping the 
# information on the groups
frame$inter <- interaction(frame$g1, frame$g2)
ggplot(frame, aes(x, y)) +  
  geom_point(aes(shape = g1, fill = g2, color = inter), size = I(4), stroke = I(2)) + 
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21,23)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "green")) + 
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("red", "black", "green")) + 
  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(color = c("red", "green"))),
         colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(fill = "white", shape = 22)))
```

## Accuracy of Perception
Human visual perception is very accurate for some qualities, but accuracy is not 100%. The following hierarchy lists judgment types from most accurate to least accurate. 

1. Position (common scale)    
e.g. bar chart, scatter plot, line graph
2. Position (non-aligned scale)    
e.g. stacked bar chart
3. Length, Direction, Angle, Slope
4. Area
5. Volume, Density, Curvature
6. Shading, Color Saturation, Color Hue


### Example
Using the previous list, which is a more accurate way to display the same data:

1. A pie chart
2. A bar chart

Answer: A bar chart is more accurate. It displays numerical information on a common, aligned scale, where a pie chart requires the reader to compare numerical information based on area or angle size. 

*** 

Complicated plots may have more than one or two important variables. When showing multivariate information, it is generally a good idea to prioritize the most important variables, placing them such that the reader can easily compare the values from those variables. 

*** 

If you have observations of height and weight over time, and height is more important than weight, how would you construct your plot?

aesthetic | variable
:-------- | :-------
x|     
y|     
color|    

Answer: 

aesthetic | variable
:-------- | :-------
x| time
y| height
color| weight

Since height is more important to show, it should be displayed using a position scale. Weight is less important, so it should be shown using a color (or shape) scale.

### Aesthetics in `ggplot2`

Main parameters: alpha, shape, color, size

### Ordering Variables

Some aesthetics are clearly ordered: size, position, and area all have natural orderings. Other aesthetics do not have natural orderings and should not be used when trying to visually illustrate magnitude. 

- Position:    
higher is larger (y), items to the right are larger (x)
- Size, Area    
bigger size or more area indicates a larger value
- Color: not always ordered.     
More contrast = larger, but hue does not indicate order in any natural way.    
Example: orange is not intuitively greater than green. Light orange, however, is intuitively "less" than dark orange. 
- Shape: Unordered    
A square is not obviously larger/bigger than a circle of the same area. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=2.5}
library(RColorBrewer)
library(gridExtra)

data <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), 
                   y = c(1, 4, 9, 10, 12), 
                   size = c(1, 4, 2, 1, 5))

p1 <- qplot(x, y, data = data, size = size, geom = "point") + 
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(2.5, 5), guide = "none") + 
  theme_bw()  + 
  theme(axis.text = element_blank())

data <- data.frame(x = factor(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)), 
                   y = c(4, 3, 1, 5, 2))

p2 <- ggplot(data = data, aes(x = x, weight = y)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.text = element_blank())

data <- data.frame(expand.grid(x = 1:6, y = rev(1:3)), 
                   color = c(brewer.pal(7, "Blues")[2:7],
                             brewer.pal(6, "Set1"), 
                             rep("black", 6)),
                   shape = c(rep(19, 6), rep(19, 6), 21:25, 8))

p3 <- ggplot(data = data, aes(x = x, y = factor(y), color = color, fill = color, shape = shape)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5) + 
  scale_fill_identity() + 
  scale_color_identity() + 
  scale_shape_identity() + 
  ylab("") + 
  xlab("") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid = element_blank(), panel.background = element_blank())

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 1)
```


## Color

- Hue: shade of color (red, orange, yellow...)
- Intensity: amount of color
- Both color and hue are pre-attentive.    
Bigger contrast corresponds to faster detection.

### Perception of Color
Color is context-sensitive: 

![](images/shadowillusion.png)

A and B are the same intensity and hue, but appear to be different.

When the context is removed, it is clear that A and B are the same color.

![](images/shadowillusionProof.png)

The human perceptual system has been optimized for perceiving natural scenes. 
When producing "unnatural" graphics showing data, it is sometimes necessary to make design accommodations so that the graphic can be easily perceived and understood. 

The following guidelines may be useful when selecting color schemes.

### Gradients
#### Qualitative schemes
When using a qualitative color scheme for a categorical variable, no more than 7 colors should be used. This is because working memory holds "7 +/- 2" values (between 5 and 9 bits of information). Using more than 7 colors requires the reader to hold more than 7 pieces of information in working memory at a time, leading to headaches and confusion. In addition, it can be hard to distinguish colors when many similar colors are present in a scale. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.height=.428}
data <- data.frame(x = 1:7, 
                   blues = brewer.pal(7, "Blues"), 
                   set1 = brewer.pal(7, "Set1"), 
                   diverge = brewer.pal(7,"RdBu"))

qplot(xmin = x-.5, xmax = x+.5, ymin = 0, ymax = 1, data = data, geom = "rect", color = I("black"), fill = set1) + 
    scale_fill_identity() + 
    ylab("") + 
    xlab("") + 
    theme(axis.text = element_blank(), 
          axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
          rect = element_blank()) + 
    coord_fixed(ratio = 1) + 
    new_theme_empty
```

#### Quantitative schemes

Gradients can be used to represent quantitative information. When using numerical variables (continuous or discrete), best practice is to use a color gradient with only one hue for positive values. These scales move from light to dark with only one color. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.height=.428}
qplot(xmin = x-.5, xmax = x + .5, ymin = 0, ymax = 1, data = data, geom = "rect", color = I("black"), fill = blues) + 
    scale_fill_identity() + 
    ylab("") + 
    xlab("") + 
    theme(axis.text = element_blank(), 
          axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
          rect = element_blank()) + 
    coord_fixed(ratio = 1) + 
    new_theme_empty
```

Sometimes, it is useful to emphasize differences in quantitative variables. For instance, it is common on maps to show values which are above and below "average". In these situations, it is permissible to use two colors - one to represent positive values, and one to represent negative values. The gradient should move through a light, neutral color (white, or in some cases light yellow), corresponding to 0 or the average value. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=1.5}
qplot(xmin = x - .5, xmax = x + .5, ymin = 0, ymax = 1, data = data, geom = "rect", color = I("black"), fill = diverge) + 
    scale_fill_identity() + 
    ylab("") + 
    xlab("") + 
    theme(axis.text = element_blank(), 
          axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
          rect = element_blank()) + 
    coord_fixed(ratio = 1) + 
    new_theme_empty
```

When working with small objects or thin lines, scales need more contrast than when working with larger areas.

#### RColorBrewer

R package based on Cynthia Brewer's color schemes (http://www.colorbrewer2.org). The package contains a number of gradient-style color schemes that integrate nicely with `ggplot2`. 

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, echo = F}
par(mar = c(0, 4, 0, 0) + 0.1)
display.brewer.all()
```

These schemes are designed for use in maps, but can often be used as-is (or slightly modified) for other types of data displays. http://www.colorbrewer2.org provides information about which schemes are colorblind friendly, can be easily photocopied, etc. 

### Color in `ggplot2`

- Factor variable:
    - `scale_colour_discrete`
    - `scale_colour_brewer(palette = ...)`
- Continuous variable:
    - `scale_colour_gradient` (define low, high values)
    - `scale_colour_gradient2` (define low, mid, and high values)
    - `scale_colour_distiller` (interpolates a discrete palette for use with continuous data)    
    This allows use of RColorBrewer schemes with continuous variables. 
    - Equivalents for fill: `scale_fill_...`
    

## Your Turn

- In the diamonds data, cut is ordinal, while price and carat are continuous
- Find a graphic that gives an overview of these three variables while respecting their types
- Hint: Start with the following code

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, out.width = "45%"}
qplot(carat, price, colour = clarity, data = diamonds)
```

### Solutions
```{r}
qplot(carat, price, colour = clarity, data = diamonds) + 
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "BuGn")
```

## Facetting
Facets are a way to extract subsets of data and place them side-by-side in graphics

- `qplot` Syntax: `facets = row ~ col` Use `.` if there is no variable for either row or column (i.e. `facets = . ~ col`)
- `ggplot` Syntax: ` + facet_wrap(~ variable)` or ` + facet_grid(row ~ col)`

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
qplot(price, carat, data = diamonds, color = color, 
      facets = . ~ clarity)
```


## Your Turn

The `movies` dataset contains information from IMDB.com including ratings, genre, length in minutes, and year of release.

```{r}
movies <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/2hqhCoM")
```

- Explore the differences in length, rating, etc. in movie genres over time
- Hint: use facetting!

### Solutions

Start by exploring year, budget, and genre. 
```{r, warning = F}
ggplot(movies, aes(x = year, y = budget, 
                   group = genre, color = genre)) + 
  geom_point()
```

There's a lot of "mush" - it's hard to see individual points. 

```{r, warning = F}
ggplot(movies, aes(x = year, y = budget, 
                   group = genre, color = genre)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = I(.2)) + 
  facet_wrap(~genre)
```

How many observations from each genre, by rating?
```{r}
ggplot(movies, aes(x = genre, fill = mpaa)) + geom_bar() 
```

How does movie length change (on average) over time, by genre?
```{r}
ggplot(movies, aes(x = year, y = length, 
                   group = genre, color = genre)) +
  geom_smooth(fullrange = F) + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 150))
```

What is the relationship between budget and rating, by genre and MPAA classification?
```{r, warning = F, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
ggplot(movies, aes(x = budget, y = rating, group = genre)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .1) +
  facet_grid(mpaa ~ genre) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) + 
  scale_x_log10()
```

# Polishing Plots

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

states <- map_data("state")
```

This section focuses on the details of plots - background colors, appearance, fonts, etc.

`ggplot` allows you to change these details to create highly customized plots.

## Plot Title


```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds) +
    ggtitle("Price vs Carat for Diamonds")
```

## Built-In Themes

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=7, collapse=T, fig.show='hold'}
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds)
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds) + theme_bw()
```

`theme_set` specifies a default theme for all plots:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

It is also possible to view the options for each theme:

```{r}
theme_bw()
```

## Customizing Theme Elements

It is possible to create a new theme or modify an existing one.

Themes are made up of elements, which fall into four broad categories:

- element_line
- element_text
- element_rect
- element_blank

Customizing each of these elements provides a lot of control over plot appearance.


### Modifying Elements
Here are some of the many plot elements that can be modified using `theme()`:

- **Axis**: axis.line, axis.text.x, axis.text.y, axis.ticks, axis.title.x, axis.title.y
- **Legend**: legend.background, legend.key, legend.text, legend.title
- **Panel**: panel.background, panel.border, panel.grid.major, panel.grid.minor
- **Strip**: strip.background, strip.text.x, strip.text.y


## Modifying a plot
In many cases, it is desireable to modify an already existing plot that has been stored in an object. 
```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=7}
p <- qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds) + 
    ggtitle("Price vs Carat for Diamonds")
p + theme(plot.title = element_text(colour = "red", angle = 20))
```

Use this power wisely: not all modifications are perceptually optimal. 

## Removing Axes

It's also possible to remove all axes (helpful for maps):

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
p + theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.length = unit(0, "cm")
)
```

## Saving your Work

The `ggsave()` function will save the last plot produced:

```{r, eval=F}
qplot(price, carat, data = diamonds)

ggsave("diamonds.png")
ggsave("diamonds.pdf")
ggsave("diamonds.png", width = 6, height = 6)
```
```{r, echo = F, fig.height = 3, collapse = T, fig.show = 'hold'}

qplot(price, carat, data = diamonds)

```

It is also possible to tell it which plot to save explicitly:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dplot <- qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds)
ggsave("diamonds.png", plot = dplot, dpi = 72)
```

## Your Turn

1. Save a pdf of a scatterplot of price vs carat
2. Open up the pdf in Adobe Acrobat (or another PDF Reader)
3. Save a png of the same scatterplot

### Solutions

```{r, fig.show = 'hide'}
qplot(price, carat, data = diamonds)

ggsave("diamonds.pdf")

ggsave("diamonds.png")
```
